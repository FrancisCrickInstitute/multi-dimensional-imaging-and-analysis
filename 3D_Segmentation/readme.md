### Demo data
* [Image_Set_1_001.tif](./Image_Set_1_001.tif) - 2D Nucleus example
* [3d_monolayer_xy1_ch2.tif](./3d_monolayer_xy1_ch2.tif) - 3D Nucleus example

### Code
During the second part of the workshop, we will be using the following notebooks
* [StarDist_Demo.ipynb](./StarDist_Demo.ipynb) - StarDist Segmentation Jupyter Notebook
* [Data_Analysis.ipynb](./Data_Analysis.ipynb) - Data Analysis Jupyter Notebook

  
## Set up the conda environment
For this module, we will be using jupyter notebooks to run our 3D segmentation with classical watershed algorithm and StarDist deep learning model, and analyse the resulting data.

To do so, we will create a conda environment during the workshop following [these instructions](conda_env_setup.md).
