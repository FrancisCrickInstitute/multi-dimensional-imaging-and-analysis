# Live Cell Imaging and Tracking

For this module, you need to set up a conda environment to analyse tracking data in Jupyter notebooks.

1. Open Anaconda Prompt and type the following to create a new environment:
    ```
   conda create --name cell-tracking
   ```
2. Check that the environment was created:
    ```
   conda env list
   ```
3. Activate your new environment so you can use it:
    ```
    conda activate cell-tracking	
    ```
4. Install the necessary packages for this session:
    ```
    python -m pip install matplotlib pandas numpy jupyter
    ```
